# Ralph Fix Plan

## High Priority
- [ ] Set up basic project structure and build system
- [ ] Define core data structures and types
- [ ] Implement basic input/output handling
- [ ] Create test framework and initial tests

## Medium Priority
- [ ] Add error handling and validation
- [ ] Implement core business logic
- [ ] Add configuration management
- [ ] Create user documentation

## Low Priority
- [ ] Performance optimization
- [ ] Extended feature set
- [ ] Integration with external services
- [ ] Advanced error recovery

## Completed
- [x] Project initialization

## Notes
- Focus on MVP functionality first
- Ensure each feature is properly tested
- Update this file after each major milestone
- **Evidence verification is REQUIRED before EXIT_SIGNAL: true**

---

## 🔒 Completion Verification (Required for EXIT_SIGNAL: true)

Before marking the project complete, verify these evidence gates:

### Evidence Gates
- [ ] All tests passing (run test command, verify exit code 0)
- [ ] Documentation generated (docs/generated/ has files OR README.md updated)
- [ ] CLI functional (--help works, if applicable)
- [ ] Changes committed (git log shows commits from this session)
- [ ] All tasks above marked [x]

### Final Steps
- [ ] Run final test suite and verify all pass
- [ ] Create summary commit with conventional message
- [ ] Verify this checklist is complete

**Note**: Ralph's evidence collector will verify these gates before allowing exit.
If gates fail, the loop continues even if EXIT_SIGNAL is true.
